Sure, here's a simple reinforcement learning script using Q-learning to predict the price of a financial instrument in trading. In this example, we'll create an environment where the agent (trader) decides whether to buy, sell, or hold a position based on the current state of the market.


- TradingEnvironment: Represents the trading environment where the agent interacts. It defines the reset() and step() methods according to the Gym interface.
- QLearningTrader: Implements the Q-learning algorithm. It selects actions based on the Îµ-greedy policy and updates the Q-table based on the rewards received.
- The price data is randomly generated for demonstration purposes, but you can replace it with real historical price data.
- The script runs for a fixed number of episodes, and the Q-learning trader interacts with the environment to learn the optimal policy.
- This is a very basic example. In real-world trading scenarios, you'd likely need more sophisticated features, risk management mechanisms, and possibly more complex reinforcement learning algorithms.
